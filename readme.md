This lets you use a webcam to scan QR codes, and POSTs the scanned ids to the library server.

## Note on autofocus

We're using C920 webcams which have a very sensitive autofocus.

I recommend [disabling autofocus](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658508/1097920):

    v4l2-ctl -c focus_auto=0

Then manually setting the focus:

    v4l2-ctl -c focus_absolute=20

For reference: `v4l2-ctl -l`

If your video device is one other than `/dev/video0`, use the `-d` flag to specify it.

## Running remotely

We're running this off of Raspberry Pis.

When SSH'd into the Pi, to launch properly:

    export DISPLAY=:0
    python3 main.py

If you need to wake the Pi's screen:

    export DISPLAY=:0
    xset s reset

## DNS

The Raspberry Pi's default DNS may be non-ideal, making API calls slow. To change the Pi's DNS servers, edit `/etc/resolv.conf` as root. Edit it to look like:

    # Generated by resolvconf
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4  

Alternately, run `sudo ./setdns.sh`, which will do the above.

**NOTE: DNS will reset upon boot.**
